A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles that help developers create maintainable and scalable software. They are widely applicable in object-oriented programming, and you can certainly apply them in Flutter when building your Flutter apps.

S.O.L.I.D. STANDS FOR:

☞ S — Single responsibility principle.

☞ O — Open closed principle.

☞ L — Liskov substitution principle.

☞ I — Interface segregation principle.

☞ D — Dependency Inversion principle.
